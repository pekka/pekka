## What I am working on right now

Right now I am mainly building Laravel and Filament based tools that solve real world problems for small businesses and self employed people.

### Autónomotools (Laravel 12 + Filament + Livewire)

A toolkit for self employed people in Spain that makes the painful parts a bit less painful.

- Hourly rate calculator that respects Spanish taxes and social security
- Debt calculator and payment planning helpers for tax and social security authorities
- Built with Laravel 12, Filament, Livewire and Tailwind
- In active development, private repo for now

### Second Filament app

I am also building a second large Filament powered application.

- Focus on pleasant, fast admin experiences with carefully themed Filament panels
- Uses Laravel 12 and the newer Filament stack
- Available to discuss once it is public or under NDA

If you work with Filament v3 or v4 and want a themed panel that feels like a custom product, feel free to reach out.

## How I like to work (with AI and with people)

I enjoy working with Claude Code, Conductor, OpenCode and similar tools. Planning together with an AI assistant, then doing closely supervised code creation, has become a new and surprisingly enjoyable way of working for me, especially in solo projects where keeping planning, documentation, and commit discipline can be a challenge.

- I always start with structure: domain model, data flows, user journeys
- I let AI help generate code, but I read and understand everything before it goes into production
- I care about careful, sensible adoption of AI instead of "just let it generate everything"
- I like teaching teams how to get real value out of AI tools without losing control of their code base

I also enjoy classic collaboration: pair programming, code reviews, whiteboard sessions and honest conversations about constraints and trade offs.

## Community, writing and teaching

I have been a long time Stack Overflow contributor with roughly seven thousand authored answers.

People usually know me there for friendly, detailed and thoroughly researched posts, and for arguing that Meta Stack Overflow should be kinder and more welcoming.

I like explaining things in simple language, documenting decisions and mentoring people who are entering web development or independent work.

## How I like to work with clients and teams

I work from a completely off grid solar powered open plan office on Lanzarote with redundant internet connections and hardware. Remote collaboration is normal for me, not an exception.

I like long term collaborations where I can help shape products and brands, but I am also happy to jump into focused projects or smaller rescue and optimization gigs.

- Long term collaboration on product teams
- Project based work with clear scopes and outcomes
- Smaller website optimization or emergency rescue work (webmechanic.cc style)

Good time zone overlap with Central Europe and workable overlap with the East Coast.

Happy to jump on a call and talk about ideas, even if there is no concrete project yet.

## A small personal note

I grew up loving nature, organic food and environmental protection and still care about them a lot today.

Away from the screen I like drawing and illustration, comics, gardening and eco construction with natural materials on our finca on Lanzarote.

If any of this resonates with you or your team, I would love to hear from you.

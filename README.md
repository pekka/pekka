# What I am working on right now

Right now I am mainly building Laravel and Filament based tools that solve real world problems for small businesses and the self-employed.

## Autónomotools (Laravel 12 + Filament + Livewire)

A toolkit for self employed people in Spain that makes the painful parts a bit less painful.

- Hourly rate calculator that respects Spanish taxes and social security
- Debt calculator and payment planning helpers for tax and social security authorities
- Built with Laravel 12, Filament, Livewire and Tailwind
- In active development, private repo for now

## Booking and fleet management app in the mobility industry (NDA)

I am also building a second large Filament powered application.

- In active development, under NDA

## Availability 

If you work with Filament v3 or v4 and want a themed panel that feels like a custom product - I am currently open for projects!

# AI powered programming (while keeping the reins)

Far from being an AI hype man, I have come to greatly enjoy working with Claude Code, Conductor, OpenCode and similar tools. 

Conductor is currently free and I cannot recommend it enough.

Planning together with an AI assistant, then doing closely supervised code creation, has become a new and surprisingly enjoyable way of working for me, especially in solo projects where keeping planning, documentation, and commit discipline can be a challenge.

# Work with clients and teams

I work from a completely off grid solar powered open plan office on Lanzarote with redundant internet connections and hardware. Remote collaboration and good practices around it are second nature to me.

I am looking for a long term collaborations where I can help shape products and brands as part of a team, but I am also very happy to contribute to focused projects or smaller rescue and optimization gigs.

- Long term collaboration on product teams
- Project based work with clear scopes and outcomes
- Smaller website optimization or emergency rescue work

I have perfect time zone overlap with Central Europe and workable overlap with the U.S. East Coast.

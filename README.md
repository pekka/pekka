# What I am working on right now

Right now I am mainly building Laravel and Filament based tools that solve real world problems for small businesses and the self-employed.

## Autónomotools (Laravel 12 + Filament + Livewire)

<img width="400" height="auto" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40432d0a-32d6-4b31-9a5d-d0468b5b7469" />

Autónomotools helps freelancers in Spain navigate the system and their financials:

- an hourly rate calculator that takes into account Spanish taxes and social security
- comparisons with employed salaries
- Balance calculators and payment planning helpers
- In active development, set to launch in 2026
 
## Booking and fleet management app (NDA, Laravel 10 + Filament + Livewire)

- Multiuser, multitenant, customer facing login area
- Booking and price calculations, transactional email, payments, SMS and Whatsapp

## Currently available for:

- Building Filament apps (entire lifecycle or as part of a team)
- deep customizations of web apps that makes them feel like a truly unique product

# AI-assisted programming

While far from being an AI hype man, I have come to greatly enjoy working with Claude Code, Conductor, OpenCode and similar tools. 

[Conductor](https://conductor.build) is currently free and I cannot recommend it enough.

[<img width="400" height="auto" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42c8c270-60ce-447f-a16f-3a5307c045a7" />]([url](https://conductor.build))


Planning together with an AI assistant, then doing closely supervised code creation, has become a new and surprisingly enjoyable way of working for me, especially in solo projects where keeping planning, documentation, and commit discipline can be a challenge.

# Work with clients and teams

I work from a completely off grid solar powered open plan office on Lanzarote with redundant internet connections and hardware. Remote collaboration and good practices around it are second nature to me.

I am looking for a long term collaborations where I can help shape products and brands as part of a team, but I am also very happy to contribute to focused projects or smaller rescue and optimization gigs.

- Long term collaboration on product teams
- Project based work with clear scopes and outcomes
- Smaller website optimization or emergency rescue work

I have perfect time zone overlap with Central Europe and workable overlap with the U.S. East Coast.
